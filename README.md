# âš— About me

- I like developing games and discovering new design principles. For that I either use pygame for desktop games or TypeScript and/or JavaScript for browser games.
- Tinkering around with Raspberry Pi Picos and other hardware is also something I'm very fond of.  
- I also like to prank people, so I always have a few repos at my disposel for when they're looking away. I also like creating my own stuff for that and thus exploring new languages and OS features.
